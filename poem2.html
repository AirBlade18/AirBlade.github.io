IIT Bombay was founded in 1958.[5] In 1961, the Parliament decreed IITs as Institutes of National Importance.[6] A committee formed by the Government of India recommended the establishment of four higher institutes of technology to set the direction for the development of technical education in the country in 1946. Planning began in 1957 and the first batch of 100 students was admitted in 1958.[6] Since its establishment in Powai, the institute has physically expanded to include more than 584 major buildings with a combined area of more than 2.2 square kilometers.

As one of the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), it is recognised as an Institute of National Importance.[3] Founded in 1959 with technical and financial assistance from the former government of West Germany, it was the third IIT that was established by the Government of India.[4] IIT Madras has been ranked as the top engineering institute in India for four years in a row (2016–2019)[5][6] by the National Institutional Ranking Framework of the Ministry of Human Resource Development.[7]

IIT Madras is a residential institute that occupies a 2.5 km² (617 acre) campus that was formerly part of the adjoining Guindy National Park. The institute has nearly 600 faculty, 10,000 students and 1,250 administrative and supporting staff.[8] Growing ever since it obtained its charter from the Indian Parliament in 1961, much of the campus is a protected forest, carved out of the Guindy National Park, home to large numbers of chital (spotted deer), black buck, bonnet macaque, and other rare wildlife. A natural lake, deepened in 1988 and 2003, drains most of its rainwater.
